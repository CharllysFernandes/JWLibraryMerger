# JWlibrary Sign Language Merger

The Playlist Merger is a Python script that allows you to merge multiple playlist files into a single file. It takes all the playlist files in the root directory and combines them into one file, making it convenient to manage and share playlists.

## Usage
1. Place all the playlist files you want to merge in the root directory of the script.
2. Run the main.py script:
```
python main.py
```
3. The script will create a new directory and store the merged playlist inside it.
Additionally, a ZIP archive named "merged_playlists.jwlibrary" containing the merged playlist file will be created.

## Requirements
Python 3.x

## Supported Playlist Format
The script currently supports playlists in format with a ".jwlibrary" extension. If your playlists are in a different format, you may need to adjust the script accordingly.
